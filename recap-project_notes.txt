Rebuild the code for the wordcount project by going through this again, writing out hte steps, and then creating branches to go off of. Maybe color code the data as well? 

##### 
The best thing right now wouold be to also create a refernce site for me, as it helps me build up my tools as I am working on the other aspects and project.s THe mas Bagua site will definitely help with things, and I will need to create my own site as well. Still hit up SNES Drunk guy, and research how to grow these sorts of things. Helping him creaete content would certianly get my name out there and start to create some buzz. 

As far as the reference site goes, what kind of information am I trying to convey/capture?

1. I would like to be able to add links to pages and discussions about new findings. 

The tendency to become a digital hoarder doesn't help. I never get back to those things. To do apps tend to not help those who don't do...
That being said, it would be nice to collect some info, and if I know i'm not going to look at it, I could build a little bucket to dumpo this info into.,
From there, I could give a timeline, and possibly see how much i have accomplished with various trackers and such. It could be a growth tracker of some sort. 
At the very least, I could add some urls, a tag, and potentially a brief description. Think of this as more of a Bookmarks with guts. 
You could time this, and it would act as a to do. This is ok for coding, but I still think It will need worked on. But at the very least- would it help me? 

Well, what about the whole CSS deal with margins? I feel like I'm probably making this harder than it should be, but I would like to have something where I can search (ala google) for the answers. Or maybe I can track how frequently I check out a particular topic. Hell, I could even keep something as simple as having a list of questions about stuff- that's the ticket:

This will allow me to write out questions i have about things, and then start to piece together a learning plan, or codifying my notes. So you ask about why you should run the server until you've changed the code to accpet postgres (I think it's only because it creates the DB, but whatever). Regardless, you can write out a question you had, and even if you have answered it, you can document it so you're not going back and doin it again. This will work for smaller topics- i'm not sure how it will do for full-scale topics. Maybe you can start to build something from that. 
Like, if you were to begin to write out all of the notes, you could add a gotcha to the posting and then go from there. THe blog post and topic can be built from the questions you asked about it. 

You would need to have something to be able to edit the content for this to work, especially if you made a post with just the question and without any research. Hmm, this is essentially stack overflow. 
But maybe I want to make SO with tracking and such. 

You could even connect, and have a list of inquisitveness. Maybe others in your group can collaborate. It is a lot like stack overflow, but for any topic imaginable. 

You could build AI into this as well. ALthough, google is doing that on its own. 

But, some more brain storming: 
you can see when the question was posted, see how long its been sitting there. You could even get an idea of how many things have been completed, and how many to date. When your most productive times are. This could be a productivity app, in a sense. [

WHat about creating a feed of info from other sites as well. I suppose you could always link, but RSS feeds are cool to, or at least something worth looking into. 


Ah, back to the app: i'd like to be able to save some things and tag them. But i never get back to them, or kind of just forget about it. So, maybe this is a way to help with digital hoarding: if you don't check this item out, maybe you should get rid of it. Did you even access it? If you did, when was the last time? 

template extending in django: would be a greate reference topic right there. You could even pin it to your dashboard, or references. It's an application for ppl trying to be productive. 

but what to do with all of the extra websites I keep? Well, what's the problem? You never go back to these, they get sent to your email and forgotten, etc. SO this is meant to be a way to decrease this clutter as well. It's your method for using all of these tools that may be the issue. I wonder if Youtube has an API? That way any videos you save can be pulled into the app and categorized as well, so you can kind of see your media at any given point. It's a thing to tie all of your resources together into one pool- to create your own library of data in a single referernce place. 

I think there is one. ANd this way you could even reference a spot in the video, or use them to learn and so on and so forth.

Ignoring git for now- current env causes issues here

There are multiple views per app, but there should only be one url file, correct?
- Not necessarilly. You can add another urlCONF by using the include functions from django.urls.
You will then need to create another url file in that app, but it does not get included in settings. 
# However, I wonder if you could and what that would do....

# It seems that the include gets used to create various sections, or it starts off as a sections and then shows it's individual posts....like 
homepage.com/blogs/

also, the app will need to have its own templates/appname/html files to look through. 
# Does this need to be added to the settings.py app?

my portfolio project includes settings, and it should not. regardless, the data templates dir is empty. This is unlike the wordcoutn project where we added this info to the file. Do apps simply ignore this kinda deal and stuff happens in the background? 

##############################

make a todo portion as well, and then clean it up to show all on the dashboard. 

next, how to get the links to work for the individual urls? need to be able to click on these and move to the details. 

next on the TODO is to make the postings editable. I could do this through admin site, but this needs to be available for all users. 

I would alse need to be able to click to create a new one as well.

CRUD, R is done. Next step would be to create or update. 

Since the same object is being manipulated in the DB, it's probably safe to keep the same DB, or app rather, to work on the data. I just need to access the info and then manipulate. 


Eventual TODOs for the project itself: 
- create something whereyou could sort based on tag or topic. 
- create something where you could break todos and questions based on a project. (I'm sure there's tons of stuff like this). 

!!- I need to go through and list everything in a step by step way like I did with the wordcount project. 
Plus, I want to be thorough and go through and compare the differences between the two tutorials. This will allow me to start building things in a tree wikipedia-like structure. 
(# Additional- you could write something to export all of that into a pdf or something for learning resources).

var_name = models.ForeignKey(<Name of model>)

# To extend templates:

Create a base.html file, I think in the app folder (will need to verify this)
Enter it's info like you would, and then use the {% block content %}{% endblock %} placeholders. THis is where the child templates unique info will go. 

In the Child page, which is really the template we a pulling up to, the first thing we enter is:
{% extends "path_to_html.html" %} 

Then, enter the information inbetween the 
{% block content %} and {% endblock content %} template tags. 


# What goes in the forms imports? 

next, the form as html in the template. Can do form.as_p first. 

A cancel button would be a cool feature as well. 

Ok, now what do I do with new entires? Wouldn't it be the same as editing? 

Yeah, instead you have no info to show with it in the beginning, so less variables to display. 

Next, will need top work on creating something for the Todo list/ app as well. 

Also, the form controls look like garbage. Need to fix because they are actually very user unfriendly. 

# Will the datetime fielsd enter itself? since it is being set to a default, i don't think I ned to enter it into the form control....

reference sites: 
- analyze other reference type sites and build a template off of that. I would like to be able to put a lot of information together in one place, so it is a type of note-taking application as well.

<link rel="icon" href="http://example.com/favicon.png">

172.16.97.195
vgpu-w10-worksoft
that is the name of the template for future reference 

Should tags replace the whole topic deal? In learning logs, you could cascade delete the topic to kill the entries. Here, I would want to not delete the topic, although if you did delete all, an entry would become stranded...

Again, I do want to be able to link all of my thoughts together or build a tutorial from it as well.

ToDO: 
Improve template tags. Actually create the app and model. Test with the shell (and write out its commands and a how to). 

1. increase the char limit on the summary portion.  Will I lose my db data if this happens? 
	- I may want to export the data, at least for now. Can this be done through the shell? 
	- ANS: No, it does not kill anything to migrate. It just updates in htis case. Use sqlite db manager to export. 

2. change the widget on form to a text area. Are forms a model? No, and DONE



Goals for the site for the week? 
1. Set it up so that I can actually start using and recording things. 
	- I suppose we are this place now, just need to deploy. Could even use the learnign logs app I have out there. 

2. Test the shell connection and understand how things work there. Create a sheet of things related to: 
	- django/ DB shell 
	- App creation? 
	- Basic setup (like the wordcount project). 
	
3. There needs to be a single place that I am recording information- too disorganized. Would like to have a place to plan out the entire project. 

4. If you create a toDo app, does the current date get passed with the request object. How would you create something that says xyz need to be updated by XYZ date? 

5. #Questions model. 
	- I would like to have something where I could keep the old entries and then update. I suppose these seperate entries could be deleted. So it's kind of like stack overflow where you can have 4 answers, but then when I feel like it I can join all of these into one post. 
	- Does the negate the reason to have an "Answered" field? It can go back and forth, from the way I'm describing it. 
	- Also, how would you create this? I don't want to have something where the question is it's own model, and then each comment is an entry model, like learning logs. Well, it is the same app... It just seems  pointless to nest things this extremely. I would rather create a list for each Answer: 
	<App>
		<Question (model) >
			- answer1 (list_item)
			- answer2 (list_item)
			- answer3 (list_item)
	</App>
	
6. Yeah, the current method is to delete the original summary, and then add answers. 
- it would be better to 



P: why having things listed as topics and todos helop get it out of your mind space and into a bite sized chunk to work on. I'm thinking about the things i need to work on, and this allows me to simply get ti out and into the todo list instead of trying to keepo it in memory. 
Remember the mindset before creating. 
c: django list field

7. link to other questions!!! I was just writing an answer about django migrations , and another qwuestion popped up. It would be cool to create a question on the spot, or to organically go to the next question. It's almost like having recommended questions afterwards. 
It's a sort of thread, or neural network that I want to tap into. How do I do this? 
OR, would tags kind of act as this? 
Yeah, SOverflow has both linked and related tags. 

8. A staging areas of questions and answers you want to accomplish right now. Queue them up, maybe start a timer, etc. 


urs3Ufm-,h0[J[

Q?: should I reroute to the entry itself, once editing? That's probably a better choice.

# Reference to widget formatting- Q?: Can you add css to the form here? 
https://drumcoder.co.uk/blog/2010/jul/17/textarea-django-form/


ToDo: 
	- tags model. 
		- create a few tags. 
		- add these to some of the questions. 
	- Create a cheat sheet for the shell commands" 
	
Display them: 
	- How? as links? 
	
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/django

StackOverflow displays them as links. See above for the url structure, which uses the tag name in the pattern. 


Ulitmately, topics should be replaced by tags. Well, topics can act like an overarching thing. 
If I keep things general, such as python, django, css, html. 
Too many tags and it gets nuts. 

Time to make a topics page? Reference page? The idea is to tie allof this together as well. I'd like to be able to add links to the topic/ reference docs created. 

Do I create an "Answered" field? DOes stackoverflow have this? 

# 
As far as a reference site goes, do I attach this to the tags app? So, if you click on the tag itself, it will take you to the main hub for that topic. This will contain all the questions, related to the topic, and a list of references to it as well. 

I also do not want to be hung up on the building of the application- this will of course be necessary, but remember the gaol was to creaete an app that others may be able to use, to learn while doing it, and to start creating a reference document for myself. 

So, I need to keep working on the DJango stuff and get that written out. 
in addition to:
HTML, 
CSS. 
Postgresql. 

In addition to general python stuff, and codifying my notes in that realm. 

Need to be able to choose from tags when creating the new entry. Again, this probably need s to replace topics. The tags are the topics. 

# Can create the ToDo, and try to import info from the tags. The issue I had with circular references may be due to the way i was using the m2m field. 

 
1. What should the template look like? How is my todo any different than question, really? Other than intent (and that i want this list to disappear), Would I simply display as a table? 
I would like to start building on refrences as well, but I suppose a lot of this can be done on pen and paper yet. 

2. I need to design the app, and that's cool. But I am again going back to needing some code to write. So much study and not enough code. But maybe that's the way it goes- you sepnd so much time planning and reading before you actually get coding. 

Q?: what was the last bit of project i was working on? The csv code for dulari. Other than that, the sharepoint project was a thing. 
I think some of the ideas I had about the youtube api made things exciting as well. Keep this in mind, because it helps motivate to build the code. 

Creating a dashboard for visualizations and understanding how to write that code will be cool too. 
I would like to back through the basics as well and record all of that stuff in a decent reference. 

Q?: How would the reference look? 
BAsit around a few general topics. Then, each topic (django.model) is a method (python.method()) or function. Draw this out: 

The conception of this reference cam e more from running into items where I know I've done before and forgot, or came back to and was stuck again. It's a way to create a quick and easy note taking method to keep my knowledge and access it efficiently. 

answered = models.Boolean()

# 
Functionality:
1. Priority level
2. topic, or tags related. 
3. title
4. Summary 
5. Date entered
6. Due date 
7. Complete (filter on this and do not display those that are complete.)
	- Will I want to be able access older ones and turn them back on? 
	- It would be nice to create something where a project can house individual aspects of the todo: Like, these can even be turned into topics or refernce pages. Each idnividual one could act as a chapter. Maybe it would simply be an overatrching tag that grouped thouse things. 
8. Estimated manhours- How wlong will this take to complete? 
9. reminders 
10. status? WIP. Expected dates. History. How many times did you move the due date. 


Possibles: 
	- A shared experience. Someone can tell you they need xyz from you. 

Displaying:
	- Don't forget the value of color coding. For now, be explicit in the form of text. 

The whole idea is to get more organized anyway. I want to be able 

Visualizations help with all of this as well, just like-color coding things. 

Write a API for all of this as well. 

Add the user portion as well. It would be cool for the user to be able to sign up for reminders or status reports. 
Build a dashboard. 

##############################

04.24.2019 

Maybe tags can show nested topics as well? Like, if I create a topic in the python area/ group, etc, this topic will be populated in the questions portion of my app. SO I choose Python for the question, and this then offer a sub category of "venv", for example. This will then link to the topic and to the todos, creating a closed circuit of info here or at least a web of questions and resources. 

ToDo app: 
1. Pages:
	- a main age, like quesitons, listing all todod (probably ordered in some way). 
	- a create portion. But maybe this always exists on the page as a form. 
	- a more detailed view of the todo. 
	- ability to mark as complete

Actually, just model it off the Wunderlist  app, to keepo things simple. 
this has a button to show completed views, which would be useful, but I bet this is written with JS, or server side interactive programming. 


Q?: Can you enter a list of options for Django to choose from? You can in dbs...

timeline: 

You can also add timers to the to do list when you are working on stuff....

I do want to add a refernce page to things, and then when ium just typing right now, i thought of wanting to add an "answered" or completed to the questions. THis small thought should be dumped into the todo app, so i can at least get it out of my head space and structured. 

title, summary, date added, 
tagged. / group
Maybe a scroll down of related questions...
priority
short term, medium term, long term (w/ details) 
Difficulty: easy, medium, hard? 
timers to complete the to do or solve a problem.
categories IF not using htis exclusively for a particular domain (currentoly only related to studying development). Maybe narrowing the scope is the best way to use this. 


@Notes: 
Be careful of not putting things in a questions:
"How do you add a list of options to choose from in DJango?"
and then also adding a task:
"Find out how to add a list of options to the model in DJango"

Although, it could be beneficial to see how many unanswered questions there are. And going to the questions for quick little recaps is useful as well. 
Ultimately, the todo app is made to quickly add something as you continue to work towards other things. 

@dates 
Need to be able to flag things as past due, potentially storing this in a db field. although, current time needs to be requested. From the system, or the request. 


QUestions and things tend to cascade. I am asking about deploying, but I would like to understand many other points and need to get others ready before I can do that. SO, a sort of prereqs can be accomplished before I execute that. You can group things together and then 


Interactivity. Be able to click on the item and then this will queue it up as next to work on. 
Like, materia colored radio buttons. You can click on (answer this next). From here, you can build out your own queues and systems. 

Maybe even click it into done, or whatever... Then the dashboards would give youy a great visual representation of the flow of things and where you stand with eveything. 

Maybe this will solve the issue of havoing questions and todods being similar at times. Being able to click the "queue it up" button on the question will allow you to define your workflow...
You can move things around, and have prerequisites there will help show what may need to be done first, what is a greater proirity, etc. 

@Note:
